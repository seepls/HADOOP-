# HADOOP-
apache Hadoop system .
set up cluster configuration 
use distributed file system 
develop hadoop mapreduce applications .

HADOOP is designed to distribute large amounts of work across a set of machines .
DISTRIBUTED FILE SYSTEM : breaks input data and sends fractions of it to several machines in your cluster .

distributing parts of problem to multiple machines to handle in parallel .
SYNCHRONIZATION : Between multiple machines 

#moore's law : (gorden moore : founder of INTEL ) number of transistor in a intnese integrated circuit doubles every two year. 
transisor  : either act as a switch or amplifier .

DATA :
structured (relational data ) , unstructured , sem structured . 

mangoDB : NoSQL : advantage of cloud computing architecture .


USER - > SYSTEM - >RDMS(relational database managment system ) 

googles solution to deal with big data :
Map Reduce (is an algorithm ) || data processed in parallel :divides task into small parts .assigns those parts to many components and collects back to get final result database .


4 MODULES OF HADOOP :
hadoop common : libraries provide file system and OS level abstraction .
YARN :framework for jobscheduling and   cluster resource managment 
HDFS :distributed storage .
mapreduce : YARN based system for parallel processing. .of large data sets .

CLUSTERS = NODE COLLECTION
